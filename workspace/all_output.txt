Based on the requirements, we can start by creating a single HTML file that contains the webpage with the heading and login details. We don't need any additional classes or functions for this simple webpage.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. index.html: This is the entrypoint file that contains the HTML structure of the webpage.

Now let's proceed with the implementation.

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Login Page</title>
    <style>
        body {
            text-align: center;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #E5A823;
        }
        .login-form {
            display: inline-block;
            margin-top: 50px;
        }
        .login-form input {
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
        .login-form button {
            font-size: 18px;
            background-color: #0055A2;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>San Jose State University</h1>
    <div class="login-form">
        <form>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Student ID"><br>
            <input type="password" placeholder="Password"><br>
            <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a complete implementation of the webpage. The HTML file contains the necessary structure, styling, and elements as per the requirements. The heading "San Jose State University" is styled with the color code #E5A823. The login details are displayed in a form with separate input fields for Student ID and Password. The sign-in button is centered on the page, with a font size of 18 and color code #0055A2.

There are no additional files or dependencies required for this simple webpage.
